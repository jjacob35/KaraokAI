# **Final Project for CS7643: Deep Learning at Georgia Tech**
## **Team Members**: Jeffrey Jacob, Hemanth Chittanuru, Uday Patil
## **Goal**: Exploring the effectiveness of Image Style Transfer Techniques for audio. Example use case is choosing a content song and a style song and creating a new song with the content of the content song, but the style of the style song. This will lead to songs that sound like they were sung by a different artist.
## **Repo**: The repo contains all notebooks that were used to experiment with the different style transfer techniques. The repo also contains sample outputs. All music was collected from YouTube clips and we do not claim to own any of the music. We are just student researchers.
